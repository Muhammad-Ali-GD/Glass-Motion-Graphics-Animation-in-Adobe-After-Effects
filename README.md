# Glass-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Adobe-After-Effects

Design

The Glass Animation is one of the easiest of Motion Graphics. This is because here we just need to add a glass shape on which text is then placed. The rest of the graphics is just animation of background and the text placed on the glass shape.

There are multiple ways to make a glass shape. Here I just used fast box blur effect to add blur on the glass rectangle and then used an inverted masked circle with inverted feather to add that little bit of glow in the shape.
